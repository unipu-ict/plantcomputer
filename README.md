# “Plant Computer” – open-spurce implementation in Java/Kotlin

**Plant Computer** is a new, improved open-source version of a 
computer system for plant replication in a controlled environment. 
The technology was based on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform, 
which includes: an automated system for remote monitoring and 
controlling climate, energy, and plant growth within a specialized, 
isolated growth chamber.

## Intro
The remotely monitored and controlled climate variables were: 
- air temperature, 
- humidity, 
- potential of hydrogen (pH), 
- electrical conductivity, 
- root zone temperature, 
- carbon dioxide level, 
- dissolved oxygen in the substrate 

and many other variables that could be digitally monitored and 
controlled within the growth chamber, to obtain different 
plant *phenotype expressions*.

Records of cultivated plants are stored in the form of so-called 
**“climate recipes”** for future replication, and the computer 
system got the popular name *“food computer”* or more specifically *“plant computer”*.

## Usage
Whole *plant computer* project and all project modules (*iotapp*)
are designed as **Gradle** project/modules. Therefore, use 
**Gradlew Wrapper** ( *./gradlew* in both Windows and Linux/Mac) 
to clean, build, test and run project/modules.

To run Gradle tasks, from IntelliJ one can use *Terminal window* 
(be in the root path where *gradlew* file is located).
(Instead of Terminal window, an alternative is to install and 
use Gradle Plugin in IntelliJ.)

#### Example:
To run *plant computer* user interface in default real *measurement mode* simply use:
```
./gradlew run
```
or more verbose:
```
./gradlew :iotapp:run --args='--simulationMode=false'
```

To run *plant computer* user interface in *simulation mode* turn it on 
(or alternatively with Gradle plugin set: run --args='--simulationMode=true').
```
./gradlew :iotapp:run --args='--simulationMode=true'
```

To run *plant computer* user interface in web browser (http://localhost:8080/):
```
./gradlew jproRun
```

To deploy *plant computer* (fat jar generated with Spring Boot) on Raspberry Pi:
```
./gradlew deploy
```
then run jar (java -jar iotapp.jar) on RPi.
